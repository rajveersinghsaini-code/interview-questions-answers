### Node.JS interview questions and answers

#### Q: Why does node.js prefer *Error-First* Callback?
A: Defensive programming is a coding technique that emphasizes anticipating potential errors and handling them proactively. By adopting a defensive mindset, developers can improve the reliability and stability of their code, reducing the risk of crashes and other issues.
Error-first callbacks are a prime example of defensive programming. By passing an error object as the first argument in a callback function, developers can catch errors early in the process and prevent them from propagating throughout the application. This technique encourages developers to handle errors proactively, reducing the risk of crashes and other issues.

In addition, error-first callbacks can help with debugging and testing. By providing detailed information about the error, such as a description and a stack trace, developers can quickly identify the source of the problem and fix it. This can save time and effort during the development process and improve the overall quality of the code.

Overall, error-first callbacks are a powerful technique for encouraging defensive programming practices in Node.js development. By adopting this technique, developers can improve the reliability and stability of their code, reducing the risk of crashes and other issues.
